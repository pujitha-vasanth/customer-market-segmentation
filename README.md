# Customer Market Segmentation with KMeans Clustering
* For this case study, I will make the assumption that I work at a bank as a Data Scientist, and I have been provided with the opportunity to work on a **customer market segmentation project**. 
* This strategy is helpful for the marketing team to launch a **targeted marketing campaign** which is tailored to a specific customer base.
* The dataset is in a CSV format, and it comprises of extensive data like balance, balance frequency, purchases, credit limit, etc., collected over the past 6 months. 
* The goal here is to divide the customers into 4 categories (Transactors, Revolvers, VIP, and New Customers) based on their past behaviour and activity, in order to maximize the maketing campaign conversion rate (percentage of customers who have completed the desired action proposed in the campaign).
