# Customer Market Segmentation with KMeans Clustering
Customer Market Segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups or categories based on similar characteristics that they exhibit. 

This strategy is useful for the marketing team to launch targeted marketing campaigns tailored to a specific customer base. This saves time, money, and resources; not to mention stats depicting higher profit growth rates in businesses that utilize strategies such as market segmentation than in ones that do not. 

Behavioral segmentation is a type of market segmentation where customers are grouped based on common behaviors exhibited such as spending habits, purchasing habits, etc. Identifying these patterns can help predict how customers will interact with a brand in the future.
